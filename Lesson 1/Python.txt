Identifiers
Identifiers are names of Variables

many parts of a program, including variables need to be named.
These names are commonly called identifiers.

Rules for identifiers in python

1. Must not start with a digit and must only use letters (uppercase and/or lowercase)
2. Names must not contain a space and should use under score to divide words.
3.Specific coding terms must not be used for anything other than their intended purpose.

Data Types

Data values in a python program can only be of a certain limited range of types. The data types we will be uing are:

int-integer(number with no fractional part) e.g. 3, 100000000, 25

float - a floating point number e.g. 3.065, 10.0, 25.5

str - string (a series of characters (letters, digits, punctuation, spaces) which might be a word or a sentence). A string id defined within a pair of quotes e.g. "this is a string" or 'this is also a string'.

bool - Boolean (has only two possible values, True or False).

Variables and Consants

At there most basic programs operate on data. Consequently programs need to do two things: display/store data, and operate on it.

The general term for the parts of a program that store data is "data structures".
general term for the description of the processing to eb caried out is an "algorithm".

There are 2 types of data structure:

1. Consant - If thw value cannot or should not change within the program e.g.GST Rate.
2. 

Variables 
In python variables do not have specified "type
